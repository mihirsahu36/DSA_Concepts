/*947. Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column

On a 2D plane, we place n stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.
A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed.
Given an array stones of length n where stones[i] = [xi, yi] represents the location of the ith stone, return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.

Example 1:
Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 5
Explanation: One way to remove 5 stones is as follows:
1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,1].
2. Remove stone [2,1] because it shares the same column as [0,1].
3. Remove stone [1,2] because it shares the same row as [1,0].
4. Remove stone [1,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
Stone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.

Example 2:
Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,2],[1,1],[2,0],[2,2]]
Output: 3*/
